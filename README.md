# SnapStudio

Creating website mockups was always a challenge for me. Most tools I found were either too complicated or didn’t have what I needed. That’s why I built SnapStudio—a simple and effective way to create mockups for websites and apps, designed to make the process quick and hassle-free for everyone.



## 🚀 Features

- **Easy-to-use mockup creation** for websites and apps.
- **Customizable templates** for various design needs.
- **Fast image rendering** with high-quality output.
- **Responsive design** support for various devices

## 🎯 Challenges Faced

While developing SnapStudio, several challenges were encountered and overcame to create a seamless experience for users:

1. **Font Family Application**: Ensuring that the correct font family was applied after rendering was initially tricky, requiring adjustments to maintain consistent typography across different devices.
   
2. **Image Quality & Alignment**: Maintaining high-quality images while ensuring they aligned properly within the mockup was a challenge. Some images were cut off, while others displayed excess portions that disrupted the design.
   
3. **Border Radius & Padding Conflicts**: Achieving the desired border radius effect proved difficult due to padding conflicts. Fine-tuning the scaling and padding resolved the issue, ensuring the mockup design looked as intended.
